# libGDX examples
Simple libGDX examples for libGDX project for Computer Graphics course.

## ShapeRenderer
[The first example](https://github.com/sklavko/libgdx-examples/tree/master/example-shaperenderer) is a basic example of drawing basic geometric shapes such as circle or rectangle using ShapeRenderer class.

## SpriteBatch
[This](https://github.com/sklavko/libgdx-examples/tree/master/example-spritebatch) is an example of how to draw a texture or a sorite on the screen using SpriteBatch class.

## Animation
There are two very simple examples ([this one](https://github.com/sklavko/libgdx-examples/tree/master/example-animation-1) and [this one](https://github.com/sklavko/libgdx-examples/tree/master/example-animation-2)) in which textures are animated through user defined Animation class. There is also an [extra example of animation](https://github.com/sklavko/libgdx-examples/tree/master/example-extra-2).

## Input handling
There are also two examples of input handling. The [first one](https://github.com/sklavko/libgdx-examples/tree/master/example-input-handling-1) is the most basic but not very effective. The [other one](https://github.com/sklavko/libgdx-examples/tree/master/example-input-handling-2) shows how it should be done instead.

## Collision detection
[This example](https://github.com/sklavko/libgdx-examples/tree/master/example-collision-detection) explains how to detect collision of two sprites using Rectangle class as sprite bounds.

## Camera
[This](https://github.com/sklavko/libgdx-examples/tree/master/example-camera) is basic example of using OrthographicCamera class.

## Game
[Here](https://github.com/sklavko/libgdx-examples/tree/master/game) you can find a simple "shoot-em-up" game created using methods explained in the previous examples.
